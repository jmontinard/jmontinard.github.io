  <h2>Drawing</h2>

  <p class="indy">
    Ever since I was young I would sit infront of the tv with my favorite show on <em>(Dragon Ball Z)</em> and recreate the charaters on a peice of paper. Early on I always knew that I love seeing something and creating my own version of it. I come from a family of creatives and a family of procrastinators lol, so I've been of an on in my artistict journey. Nonetheless it will always be a passion of mine and given the current climate of the world my inpsiration has been sparked again.

    I love being a creative so the ability to bring things to life makes me feel great especially when it gets executed exactly the way it was in my head. I like taking things and putting my own spin on it, so I like to label myself a reimaginer, lol if thats a word

  <p class="indy" >Lately I've been utilizing my 2016 Ipad Pro w/ the gen 1 apple pencil  to draw since the sketchbook app has all the tools I need all in one place. It's been a game changer and the allowed me to do things that I could never before do.</p>
